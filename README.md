# Sentiment-Analysis-Project-using-Classification-method (Summer Internship ML Project)

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis with Classification projectâ€”a result of an enriching summer internship in machine learning! This project delves into the fascinating realm of sentiment analysis, where the objective is to discern sentiments expressed in textual data. Throughout the internship, we focused on employing classification methods to build a robust sentiment analysis model.

# Key Highlights:

1)Dataset Exploration:

In-depth exploration of sentiment-labeled datasets to unravel patterns and nuances crucial for effective sentiment analysis.

2)Preprocessing Techniques:

Implementation of text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization and elimination of stop words, to enhance the quality of textual data for subsequent machine learning tasks.

3)Feature Extraction:

Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques for extracting meaningful features from text, transforming raw data into a format conducive to machine learning algorithms.

4)Model Selection:

Evaluation and selection of classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes to determine the most effective model for sentiment analysis.

5)Model Training and Tuning:

Rigorous model training using labeled data, coupled with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, to optimize performance and accuracy.

# Project Outcomes:
A finely-tuned sentiment analysis model capable of categorizing text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
Insights into the strengths and limitations of various classification methods in the context of sentiment analysis.

# Future Work:
Exploration of additional classification algorithms and their impact on sentiment analysis accuracy.
Consideration of real-world deployment scenarios for the sentiment analysis model.
